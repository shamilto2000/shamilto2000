- 👋 Hi, I’m @shamilto2000
- 👀 I’m interested in using Drupal to build medium-sized, medium-complex sites for non-profit organizations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GIT properly!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on survival.
- 📫 How to reach me: my day job is as a senior lecturer in management, so I'm easy to find on the web.
